Hello Team,I’m currently working on a project with a power generation company that operates multiple plants, and I’m looking to understand how materials used in these power plants are identified and classified as critical. Please help in finding an expert who could provide insights on the following:

- What key factors should be considered when defining materials as critical vs. non-critical?
    - From both an operational and supply chain perspective
    - Any additional criteria used to assess criticality
- Is there a material criticality scoring matrix or framework in place?
- How is the critical material classification used by different teams (e.g., planning, maintenance, procurement)?

We’re aiming for a quick turnaround and would like to schedule **one or two short calls either later tonight or tomorrow** to go over this. Your support is much appreciated—thanks in advance!Thanks in advance for your support!RegardsAnurag
